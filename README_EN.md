## 🧠 Key Features

### 🛡️ Multi-Layer Protection
- **Behavioral Detection:** Uses AI to detect abnormal patterns and unknown threats.  
- **Identity & Privacy Management:** Protects user data and prevents leaks.  
- **Comprehensive Scan Engine:** Analyzes links, files, and images for hidden malware and malicious code.

### ⚙️ Intelligent Architecture
- **Asynchronous Microservices:** Flexible, fault-tolerant, and horizontally scalable design.  
- **Adaptive Secure Routing:** Dynamically randomized operation paths to prevent tracing.  
- **Layered Encryption:** Combines AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 for maximum security.

### 📊 Self-Monitoring & Maintenance
- **Self-Healing Monitor Bot:** Continuously watches system health and auto-recovers from issues.  
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Integrated with Prometheus & Grafana for threat and performance analytics.  
- **Real-Time Logging & Insights:** Uses Tracing library for comprehensive and instant system activity analysis.
